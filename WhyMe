Q1) I love software and enjoy playing with code — especially when it comes to building tools that help others visualize and understand data better. I'm excited about contributing to open source and want to be part of a community where I can learn, collaborate, and grow as a developer.

Since I'm aiming for GSoC next year, I'm using this opportunity to get hands-on experience working with real-world projects. I want to contribute not just as a user but as a developer who understands the internals and helps improve the library for others.

I love analysing codes so that’s why I want to be part of this project

Q2) I love analyzing code and enjoy debugging a lot since I do competitive programming. That’s what inspires me to be a PM for the MPL Open Source Project , I want to help improve the project and also grow my skills by working with real codebases.
My main commitments this year are the Math Guild and the CP Guild. But I’m confident I can manage my time well and give proper attention to this project too. Time management won’t be an issue for me.

Q3) I've been doing competitive programming for the past 2 years and have consistently taken part in various hackathons. One of my major achievements was becoming a national finalist in the Amazon HackOn, which also led to an internship offer from Amazon. Overall, I've gained a lot of experience in coding through contests, projects, and real-world problem-solving.

Q4) I am Prasanna Bhavan from New Delhi and I love coding; that’s the interesting thing which I can think of
